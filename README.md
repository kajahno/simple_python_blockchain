# Simple blockchain using Python

The purpose of this personal project is two things:
1) Learn more Python
2) Learn about the Blockchain

The code is still a work in progress.

* Create a python3 virtual environment
  ```bash
  $ virtualenv -p $( which python3 ) .venv
  ```
* Install dependencies from requirements.txt
  ```bash
  (.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
